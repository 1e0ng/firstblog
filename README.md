First Blog
==========

This is a blog in Python. I write this because I don't find a beautiful blog.

`First Blog` is based on [shire](https://github.com/liangsun/shire) framework, which means it uses Tornado Web Server + MongoDB for back-end and Bootstrap for front-end.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have successfully installed `MongoDB` and `Python 2.7`

(To prepare a production environment, you may also need `nginx`, `supervisord`.)

```
pip install -r pip-req.txt

python scripts/init.py

python start.py
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8004>

Go hacking!
